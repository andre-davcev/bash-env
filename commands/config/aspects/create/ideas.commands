Idea Selection
1) Idea selection is usually a much smoother process. Again I prefer to work with a structure.
2) Scrap the obvious bad ideas after you’ve checked them if they can’t be combined with your other ideas.
3) Use any preferred technique to reduce your ideas to two/three concepts.
4) Take each concept to the next level. More than that you should.
5) Open your computer, start with intensive communication with your client.

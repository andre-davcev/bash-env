Leading (Line Spacing) - 0.3em-0.5em > Font Size
{line-height: 150%;}

Remember the line-height CSS property.
A good rule of thumb is line-spacing thatâ€™s at least 140% of your text size (ie line-height: 1.5em)

If the rhythm of the page is to be maintained, the spacing of paragraphs should be related to the basic line height.
This is achieved simply by setting top- and bottom-margins equal to the line height.
